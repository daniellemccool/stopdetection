  abstract  = "The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition
               technologies (GPS, GSM networks, etc.) enables people to
               conveniently log their location history into spatial-temporal
               data, thus giving rise to the necessity as well as opportunity
               to discovery valuable knowledge from this type of data. In this
               paper, we propose the novel notion of individual life pattern,
               which captures individual's general life style and regularity.
               Concretely, we propose the life pattern normal form (the
               LP-normal form) to formally describe which kind of life
               regularity can be discovered from location history; then we
               propose the LP-Mine framework to effectively retrieve life
               patterns from raw individual GPS data. Our definition of life
               pattern focuses on significant places of individual life and
               considers diverse properties to combine the significant places.
               LP-Mine is comprised of two phases: the modelling phase and the
               mining phase. The modelling phase pre-processes GPS data into an
               available format as the input of the mining phase. The mining
               phase applies separate strategies to discover different types of
               pattern. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using GPS
               data collected by volunteers in the real world to verify the
               effectiveness of the framework.",
