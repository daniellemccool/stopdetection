#' Move Merger
#'
#' Handles move/track events that do not meet specific thresholds to be
#' considered. This is based on the researcher-decided total number of
#' allowable locations that the discarded track can consist of, as well as a
#' maximum total time length that may elapse. Tracks can be merged into the
#' preceding stop or excluded. Future versions of this should consider assigning
#' to the closest stop for \code{small_track_action = merge}.
#'
#' @param events data.table of events from \code{\link{returnStateEvents}}
#' @param small_track_action One of "merge" or "exclude" for specifying the
#'   method of handling mergeable tracks
#' @param max_locs Maximum number of locations for a track to be mergeable. Set
#'   to Inf to not consider.
#' @param max_time Maximum time elapsed (seconds) for a track to be mergeable.
#'   Set to Inf to not consider.
#' @param max_dist Maximum distance (meters) traveled while on track to be
#'   mergeable. Set to Inf to not consider.
#'
#' @return Modifies events data.table by reference
